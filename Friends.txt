Childhood Friends: Forever Bound
------------------------------------------
In life's journey, hand in hand,
Through ups and downs, we firmly stand.
A bond of trust that never bends,
Forever, we're true friends, yaar!

Through laughter's joy and tear's embrace,
Together, we find our happy space.
With you, life's moments are a charm,
Side by side, we'll weather any storm.

In memories made and stories shared,
A friendship that cannot be compared.

In childhood days of fun and cheer,
Together, we laughed, without a fear.
With games and dreams, we'd play and roam,
Childhood friendship, a cherished home.
